## ⛵ What is LLD?

Low-Level Design (LLD) is the detailed design of individual modules and components of a system at low level. It emphasizes on the low level details of the system like interfaces of clients, readabilty , maintainabilty and scalabilty of system at code level.

---

## 🛺 What constitutes LLD

1. Master Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
2. Learn UML notations
3. Learn SOLID Principles
4. Deep dive into Design Patterns
5. Practise standard problems of LLD interviews
6. Learn the art of Designing great API constracts
7. Learn Database schema design skills
8. Learning failure handling
9. Learn Unit testing
10. Multithreading and Thread safety

## 🧱 OOPs

Before diving into LLD, mastering **OOPs** is a must. Focus on:

### Core OOP Concepts:
- Classes & Objects
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance (is-a)
- Composition (has-a)
- Polymorphism (compile/runtime)

### Advanced Topics:
- Aggregation vs Composition
- Overriding vs Overloading
- Interfaces vs Abstract Classes
- Cohesion & Coupling
