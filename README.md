## 🧰 What is LLD?

Low-Level Design, is a phase in the software development process where detailed system components and their interactions are specified, along with their implementation details. 

It involves converting the high-level design into a more detailed blueprint, addressing specific algorithms, data structures, interfaces, performance, unit testing mechanisms, failure handling and Optiomally designing APIs and Database tables.

LLD serves as a guide for developers during coding, which ensures the accurate and efficient implementation of the system's functionality.

## 📚 Solid Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five key principles of object-oriented design that help create clean, scalable, and maintainable software. 
These principles make your codebase easier to understand, extend, and refactor.

It stands for 

🏂 S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**A class should have only one reason to change.**

🧘 O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.**

🎖 L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking the program.**

🎸 I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don’t use.**

🎧 D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.**

🧠 Note
> These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and are foundational in designing robust object-oriented systems.

## 🤩 Clean Coding 

Writing **clean code** is about crafting software that is easy to read, maintain, and extend. It focuses on **clarity, simplicity, consistency, and intent**, rather than cleverness. Clean code reduces bugs, improves collaboration, and makes debugging faster.

> _"Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares."_  
> – Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)

### 🧭 Principles of Clean Code

- 📛 **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive variable, method, and class names.
- 📏 **Small Functions**: Functions should do one thing and do it well.
- 🧹 **Clean Formatting**: Maintain consistent indentation, spacing, and structure.
- 🧪 **Avoid Duplication**: Follow the **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** principle.
- 🧠 **Code for Humans**: Your code should be self-explanatory, even without comments.
- 🔀 **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function should have only one reason to change.
- 🔥 **Error Handling**: Use exceptions, not return codes. Handle errors close to their source.
- 🪓 **Remove Dead Code**: Eliminate unused code paths, variables, and methods.
- 💬 **Minimal Comments**: Code should explain itself — comments are for complex logic or decisions only.

> 🔁 Writing clean code is not a one-time task — it’s a mindset and a habit built over time.

## 🧳 API designing

Designing high-quality APIs is at the heart of building scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly backend systems. A good API acts as a contract between different components or services, and when designed well, it enables ease of integration, clear communication, and long-term stability.

This section outlines key principles and best practices for designing clean, RESTful APIs that are easy to understand, evolve, and use.


### 🏆 Self explainatory Name
- API endpoints should clearly reflect their intent through naming.
- Avoid side effects or unexpected behavior not implied by the name.
- Use nouns for resource names and HTTP methods to convey action:

Example:
```
GET /users/{id} → fetch user info

POST /orders → place a new order
```

### 🎸 Follow Single Responsibility Principle
- Each API should perform one well-defined task.
- If an API handles multiple logical flows based on input, split it into separate endpoints.
- This enhances modularity, testing, and reusability.



### 🎖 Clear Request, response structures and API paths
- Use consistent and clear naming conventions for attributes in both requests and responses.
- Document the request/response schemas (use OpenAPI/Swagger for standardization).
- Keep API paths hierarchical, resource-based, and REST-compliant:

```
✅ GET /users/{userId}/orders
❌ GET /getAllOrdersByUserId
```

### 🎭 Clear Errors with  Status Codes
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 400, 401, 404, 500, etc.).
- Include meaningful error messages and optional error codes in the response body.

```
{
  "error": "UserNotFound",
  "message": "No user found with ID 1234"
}
```

### 🥋 Use Versioning
- Always version your APIs to allow for backward-incompatible changes.
- Use URI versioning like
  
```
/api/v1/users
or header-based versioning.
```
 
### 🔑 Implement Authentication & Authorization

- Use standards like OAuth2, JWT, or API keys to secure your APIs.
- Ensure role-based access control (RBAC) is properly enforced.


### 🏹 Rate limit APIs

- Use rate limiting to prevent abuse, reduce load, and ensure fair usage.
- Respond with 429 Too Many Requests when the limit is exceeded.


### 🎪 Support Pagination
- For large datasets, implement pagination using query parameters:
`GET /orders?page=2&limit=50`
- Use standard patterns like cursor-based or offset-based pagination

### 🎛 Idempotency 
- APIs should be idempotent—repeated calls with the same input should produce the same result without causing unintended side effects.
- This is especially important for PUT, DELETE, and retryable POST requests in order to prevent duplication or inconsistent state in case of network failures or client retries.
- Idempotency ensures safety, predictability, and robustness in distributed systems

## 🧸 Unit testing

Unit testing is the practice of testing individual units of code (typically functions or classes) in isolation to ensure they work as expected. These tests are fast, reliable, and help you catch bugs early, making your codebase more maintainable and robust.

Unit tests should not depend on databases, network calls, or external services — they strictly validate the business logic in isolation.

### 🕰 Best Practices

- ✅ Test one unit at a time – Keep tests focused and scoped.
- 🧪 Use mocks/stubs/fakes to isolate external dependencies.
- 🧱 Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) when possible: write the test before the implementation.
- 🎯 Aim for high coverage, but don’t obsess over 100% — focus on critical paths.
- 📖 Keep test code clean and readable – treat it with the same care as production code.
- 🧩 Use meaningful test names to describe behavior: `shouldThrowException_whenInputIsInvalid()`


### 📦 Common Libraries and Tools

| Language   | Framework       | Testing Tool             | Mocking Tool      |
|------------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|

## 🦅 Error Handling

Exception handling in APIs plays a critical role in delivering a predictable and smooth client experience. Proper handling ensures that clients receive **meaningful feedback**, developers can **debug issues effectively**, and systems remain **resilient and observable**.

A well-handled exception should:
- Return **clear and consistent error messages** to client.
- Use **standard HTTP status codes** to convey the type of failure.
- Separate **business logic** from **error management**.
- Enable clients to implement **retries with exponential backoff** in retriable scenarios (e.g., 5xx errors).

### 🏄‍♂️ Best Practices

- ✅ **Use custom exception classes** for domain-specific error handling.
- 🧭 **Map exceptions to appropriate HTTP status codes**:
  - `400` – Bad Request (e.g., validation error)
  - `401` – Unauthorized
  - `403` – Forbidden
  - `404` – Not Found
  - `500` – Internal Server Error
- 🔍 **Do not silently swallow exceptions** – log complete stack traces for debugging.
- 🔄 **Differentiate between**:
  - Business logic failures
  - Dependency/infrastructure failures (e.g., DB/3rd party APIs)
  - User input errors
- 📊 **Emit structured logs and metrics** for success/failure events – useful for observability and alerting.
- 🧪 **Always validate and sanitize** user inputs to prevent cascading failures.
